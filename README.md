#Vibrobag (Arduino Code)
This projects aims to create a handbag (the kind of things women carry around with them everywhere) that provides them with a little more information about its content.
Specifically about the status of their smartphone. 

To provide some ideas to what I want to achive, here are some use cases:
* Is there a new message coming? The bag vibrates.
* Is there a message avaiable? An LED on the bag lites up.
* Can't find your phone in your bag? As soon as you open it, the display will activate.

This devices works with an android app, found [here](https://github.com/Rosthouse/Vibrobag)


The project is based the Adafruit BLE breakout, and uses some code from their [examples](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF8001)
